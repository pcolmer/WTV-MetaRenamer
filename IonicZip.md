When WTV-MetaRenamer was being distributed as a complete package, the DLL file used to unzip data was included as can be seen in the documentation.

That is no longer the case so this document provides information about where to find the DLL file and other supporting documentation.

To download the DLL:

* Go to https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=dotnetzip
* Click on "download archive"
* Extract all of the files from the archive
* Go into releases > 0
* Rename "12351bfe-1a17-440e-967d-08d0eb960d24" to "12351bfe-1a17-440e-967d-08d0eb960d24.zip"
* Go into 12351bfe-1a17-440e-967d-08d0eb960d24.zip > DotNetZip-v1.9
* Copy Ionic.Zip.dll into the same directory as WTV-MetaRenamer
